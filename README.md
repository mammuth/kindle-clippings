This is a pretty simple django application with a good'ol HTML frontend generated by django. It's hosted on Divio.

#### Project setup
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Open a new terminal and create a new superuser: `docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser`
- Open `localhost:8000` and log in as the superuser
- In _DJANGO CMS_ -> _Pages_ create a new page
- Name it however you like and click _Save and continue editing_
- Go to _Advanced Settings_, in _APPLICATION_ field choose _Clipping Manager Application_ and save it
- Click on _Open example.com_ button and you are good to go :rocket:

Additional:
- manage.py commands can be executed as follows: `docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate`
- Optionally configure the `EMAIL_URL` environment variable when you want to send mails (`cp .env-local.example .env-local`)
