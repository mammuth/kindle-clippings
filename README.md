Feel free to open issues or PRs!
This is a pretty simple django application with a good'ol HTML frontend generated by django. It's hosted on Divio.

#### Project setup
1. Copy environment file: `cp .env-local.example .env-local`
2. Start containers: `docker-compose up --build`
3. Run migrations: `docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate`
4. Create superuser: `docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py createsuperuser`
5. Configure Django CMS apphook (see below)

#### Django CMS Apphook Configuration
After starting the server, you need to configure the Django CMS apphook for the app to work:

1. Go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in with your superuser account
2. Navigate to **CMS → Pages**
3. Click **"New Page"** and give it a title (e.g., "Reading Notes")
4. Save the page, then click on **"Advanced settings"**
5. In the **APPLICATION** dropdown, select **"Clipping Manager Application"**
6. Set **APPLICATION INSTANCE NAME** to `clipping_manager`
7. Save and **Publish** the page
8. The app is now accessible at the page URL (e.g., `/en/reading-notes/`)

#### Other commands
- manage.py commands can be executed as follows: `docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py migrate`
- Optionally configure the `EMAIL_URL` environment variable when you want to send mails


## Roadmap
- Integrate with more services than just Kindle
- Restful API for retrieving ones notes
